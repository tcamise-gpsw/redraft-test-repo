# API Design v2 Proposal

> **Status**: Draft — under review

## Overview

This proposal outlines the second major revision of our internal REST API, focusing on
consistency, versioning, and backwards compatibility.

## Background

The current API (v1) was designed rapidly and has accumulated several inconsistencies:

- Mixed snake_case and camelCase field names
- Inconsistent error response shapes
- No standard pagination envelope
- Missing rate limit headers on several endpoints

## Versioning Strategy

A change is breaking if any existing client would need to update to stay functional.
Non-breaking changes ship within the current version; breaking changes require a new version.

    C([Proposed API change]) --> Q{Breaking change?}
    Q -- No --> M[Ship within /v1/\nBump minor version]
    Q -- Yes --> V[Introduce /v2/ endpoint]
    V --> D[Add deprecation header to /v1/\nX-Deprecation-Date]
    D --> S{v1 traffic < 5% for 30 days?}
    S -- No --> S
    S -- Yes --> R[Remove /v1/ endpoint]
```

## Request / Response Sequence

```mermaid

    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```
